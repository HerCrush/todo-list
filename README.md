# To-do list
An app that allows the creation of lists of tasks. The goal of making this project was to apply the different newly learnt **object oriented programming** principles.

I also implemented the [Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) for the first time in order to save user data between sessions.

## How to use
**Add tasks** to the default "To do:" project by clicking on the "**+**" button below it. You can specify title, description, due date, and level of importance.
Assignments can be marked as done when completed, as well as edited or deleted.

You can also **create other projects** to separate your to-dos by concerns by entering a title in the "New Project" field and clicking the button on its right. Click the cross on its right to delete a project.

Jump to a specific project with the navigation panel on the left of the screen.
